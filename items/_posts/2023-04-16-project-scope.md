title: Project Scope
---

This site is about my and my spouse's direct ancestors and their partners, as well as the direct descendents of my great-grandparents and their partners.
I will acknowledge living people, but will not publish research on them.

For each person I will attempt to document:

- Birth and death
- Immediate relatives
- Education and employment
- Notable events

I will describe the places and events associated with my family.
My goal is to give readers context to understand people's lives, not to build an atlas.
I will write brief summaries with relevant details, and provide references for more information.

I will cite sources for information on this site.
I will republish source media, where possible.
I will write research logs that document what I've looked for, where I've looked, what I've found, and what next steps remain.
