title: Site Launched

And we're live! Well, sort of.

I began working on this site a week ago, on March 18, 2023.
My aim is to work incrementally, at a slow and steady pace.
In past projects I quickly became overwhelmed with the complexity, and they fizzled.
I bit off more than I could chew in one mouthful.

So even though there are still many technical items to work out, I've made the site live and accessible.
I can figure out how to cite sources and cross-reference pages effectively as time goes on.
And at some point, I can start putting real work into writing content, one page at a time.
