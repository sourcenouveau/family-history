and my spouse's grandparents:

Genealogy has been a lifelong hobby of mine, and much of my effort has been spent accumulating facts and records.
When my father passed several years ago I shifted my focus toward crafting something from that research.
I want to tell my family's stories in a format that is interesting and easy to share.
I want the information I present to be accurate and supported by evidence.

This site is my ongoing project to achieve those goals.
If you find it useful or have questions or thoughts, I'd love to hear from you.
